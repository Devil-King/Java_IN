//WAP to find out Leap year or not
// A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). 
// The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.

// For example,

// 1999 is not a leap year
// 2000 is a leap year
// 2004 is a leap year
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	 int year;
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  year = sc.nextInt();
   
   if (year % 400 == 0) {
      System.out.println(year+" is a leap year.");
   }
   
   else if (year % 100 == 0) {
      System.out.println(year+" is not a leap year.");
   }
   
   else if (year % 4 == 0) {
      System.out.println(year+" is a leap year.");
   }
   
   else {
      System.out.println(year+" is not a leap year." );
