// Write a code to find all the possible permutations in which N people can occupy R number of seats in a classroom
// N students are looking to find R seats in a classroom.
//Some of the seats are already occupied and only a few can be accommodated in the classroom. 
//The available seats are assumed as R and N number of people are looking to accommodate within the room.

// Hint :
// nPr = n! / (n-r)!

// Example
// Input:
// Enter the num of people: 9
// Enter the number of seats available: 5

// Output:
// Num of ways people can be seated: 15120
